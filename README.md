# Data2

Data for the article "Numerical modelling of earthquake sequences involving pumping and valving of fluids"

The section method in this article describes the numerical models where the data contained in the different folders are generated (i.e., shear stress, fault velocity, etc.)

"Apparant_friction_coefficient_Data.xlsx" file is an excel file with the average apparent friction coefficient at the onset of fault slip for different fluid expansion and fault permeability.

"Script_Figure5.m" file is a Matlab script to draw Figure 5 in the article.

"Script_Figure6.m" file is a Matlab script to draw Figure 6 in the article.
